# Assignment
In this assignment, we used Amazon Lex and Amazon Lambda to create a Robo Advisor for Retirement Portfolio creation. 

# We used the following as inputs for the bot:

Name, Age, Investment Amount, and Risk Threshold 

# The bot output the following recommendations based on risk threshold:

none: "100% bonds (AGG), 0% equities (SPY)"

very low: "80% bonds (AGG), 20% equities (SPY)"

low: "60% bonds (AGG), 40% equities (SPY)"

medium: "40% bonds (AGG), 60% equities (SPY)"

high: "20% bonds (AGG), 80% equities (SPY)"

very high: "0% bonds (AGG), 100% equities (SPY)"
